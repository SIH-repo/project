'https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2024.html', 'Description': 'A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.   These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third party components included in Oracle products.   These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.   Refer to  “Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”  for information about Oracle Security advisories.   These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third party components included in Oracle products.   Refer to   for information about Oracle Security advisories.  Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 441 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   April 2024 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE ID . A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE ID in all risk matrices. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about conditions required to exploit the vulnerability and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Vulnerabilities in third party components that are not exploitable through their inclusion in Oracle products are listed below the respective Oracle product\\'s risk matrix. Starting with the July 2023 Critical Patch Update, a  VEX  justification is also provided. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy that further supplements the  Lifetime Support Policy  as explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Critical                     Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added                      since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be                     reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: Oracle  continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously  exploit vulnerabilities                     for which Oracle has already released fixes. In  some instances, it has been reported that attackers have                     been successful  because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore                     strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update                    fixes without delay. This  Critical Patch Update contains 319 new security fixes across the product families                     listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle                     Software Security Assurance activities is located at                                           July 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis .  Please note that since the release of the April 2019 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released two Security Alerts for Oracle WebLogic Server:    CVE-2019-2725 (April 29, 2019)  and   CVE-2019-2729 (June 18, 2019) . WebLogic Server customers are strongly advised to apply the fixes contained in this Critical Patch Update, which provides the fixes for the previously-released Alerts as well as additional fixes. Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product                 area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column.                 Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation                 for patch availability information and installation instructions.              Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with                     this advisory. Risk matrices for previous  security fixes can be found in                      previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts .                     An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is                       here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability                     is identified by a  CVE#  which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability.                     A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk                     matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics   indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product,                     but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see                      Oracle CVSS Scoring                       for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Oracle conducts an analysis  of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update.                     Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix                     and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required                     to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle  provides this information, in part,                     so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage.                     For  more information,                     see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . The  protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if  applicable) are affected as                     well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an  affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is                     also  affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix  only if it is the  only                      variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update                     fixes as soon as possible .  Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk                     of  successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack.  For attacks that require                     certain privileges or access to certain  packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the                     packages  from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of  successful attack. Both                     approaches may break application functionality,  so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes                     on  non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a  long-term solution as neither corrects                     the underlying problem. Oracle  strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as  possible. For customers that                     have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security                     fixes  announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review                      previous Critical Patch Update advisories                      to determine appropriate actions. Patches  released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only  for product versions that                     are covered under the Premier Support or  Extended Support phases of the                       Lifetime Support Policy .                      Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that  patches released through the Critical                     Patch Update program are available  for the versions they are currently running. Product  releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not  tested for the presence                     of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of                     affected  releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle  recommends that customers                     upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with                     the Software Error  Correction Support Policy explained in                      My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 .                     Please review the  Technical Support Policies                      for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to: Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   January 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE#  which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support. The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: Oracle acknowledges people who have contributed to our Security-In-Depth program (see  FAQ ). People are acknowledged for Security-In-Depth contributions if they provide information, observations or suggestions pertaining to security vulnerability issues that result in significant modification of Oracle code or documentation in future releases, but are not of such a critical nature that they are distributed in Critical Patch Updates.

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE#  which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 .

The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.   These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.   Refer to  “Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”  for information about Oracle Security advisories.   These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.   Refer to   for information about Oracle Security advisories.  Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE#  which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible.

These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.   These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.   Refer to  “Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”  for information about Oracle Security advisories.   These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.   Refer to   for information about Oracle Security advisories.  Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite  CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022) . Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches. Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE#  which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Security Alert. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well.

Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:\\xa0 Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to: Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions. Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE#  which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 284 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   January 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions. Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in   previous Critical Patch Update advisories . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE#  which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in  italics  indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.   These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.   Refer to  “Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”  for information about Oracle Security advisories.   These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.   Refer to   for information about Oracle Security advisories.  Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 433 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   April 2023 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE ID . A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE ID in all risk matrices. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product\\'s risk matrix. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third party components included in Oracle products.   These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.   Refer to  “Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”  for information about Oracle Security advisories.   These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third party components included in Oracle products.   Refer to   for information about Oracle Security advisories.  Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. This Critical Patch Update contains 387 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at   October 2023 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis . Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column. Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.  Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in  previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is   here . Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  CVE ID . A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE ID in all risk matrices. Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see  Oracle CVSS Scoring  for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies . Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product\\'s risk matrix. Starting with the July 2023 Critical Patch Update, a  VEX  justification is also provided. The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the  only  variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible . Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review  previous Critical Patch Update advisories  to determine appropriate actions. Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the   Lifetime Support Policy . Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running. Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions. Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  My Oracle Support Note 209768.1 . Please review the  Technical Support Policies  for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
